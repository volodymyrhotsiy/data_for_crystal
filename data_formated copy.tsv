cd0cc9de	"You are tasked with answering a multiple-choice test in the context of a family task-assignment app. In this app, parents (the ""reporter"") assign tasks to their children (the ""assignee"").

Exemple:

The provided structured data includes:

1. Information about the reporter (parent) and assignee (child), such as their roles, ages, and status.
2. A chat history between the parent and child, showing their interactions, which may include reminders, task-related discussions, or casual conversations.
3. A task history with previously assigned tasks from the parent to the child, and any tasks the child has requested.
4. A user prompt from the parent that specifies the current goal or problem (e.g., limiting screen time, encouraging homework, or promoting a hobby).

ad3cc6ad	"You are tasked with answering a multiple-choice test in the context of a family task-assignment app. In this app, parents (the ""reporter"") assign tasks to their children (the ""assignee"").

Exemple:

The provided structured data includes:

1. Information about the reporter (parent) and assignee (child), such as their roles, ages, and status.
2. A chat history between the parent and child, showing their interactions, which may include reminders, task-related discussions, or casual conversations.
3. A task history with previously assigned tasks from the parent to the child, and any tasks the child has requested.
4. A user prompt from the parent that specifies the current goal or problem (e.g., limiting screen time, encouraging homework, or promoting a hobby).

Example: ""input"": {

        }
      },
      {
        ""assignee"": {
          ""message"": ""<str: response, e.g., 'It was okay. We had art class, and I drew a spaceship.'>""

      }
    ],
    ""user_prompt"": ""<str: user task-oriented request, e.g., 'I want my son to limit his video game time and focus on homework and hobbies.' >""
  }

You will be given a multiple-choice test with several task options. Your job is to select the correct task for assignee (child) that best fits the context and the user's prompt.

Ensure that your answer reflects the task that aligns most closely with the goals and relationship dynamic between the parent and child.
